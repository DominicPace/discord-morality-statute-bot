Morality Statue Discord Bot
by Dominic Pace

Description: This bot is meant to imiate the Morality Statue device in the movie Demolition Man. This Discord bot will create an alert (fine) in the server whenever someone curses. Curses are determined by the "alt-profanity-filter" Python package. It also adds two commands to the server:

* /top10-violators
* /outstanding-fines $discord-user

This discord bot was built to run on Replit (replit.com). Relies on ReplitDB.

You'll need to add your Discord token to the "secrets enviroment variables" in Replit.
